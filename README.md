# Echosign REST Api
This library handles responses and request for Adobe's Echosign REST API v3. Please take a look at their documentation for more explanation on what their service provides.
https://secure.echosign.com/public/docs/restapi/v3

## Requirements
PHP 5.4, php ext-filter. You will need to have an oAuth token generated by Adobe to interact with their service. You can sign up online at https://www.echosign.adobe.com/en/home.html

## Installation
In the `require` key of `composer.json` file add the following

    "nsbucky/echosignv3": "dev-master"

## Usage
All endpoints are available. Each endpoint needs an oAuth token and transport to function. A default transport provided by GuzzleHttp comes standard.

    use Echosign\Transports\GuzzleTransport;
    use Echosign\BaseUris;
    
    $transport   = new GuzzleTransport();
    $baseUris    = new BaseUris( 'YOUR oAUTH TOKEN', $transport );
    $baseUriInfo = $baseUris->getBaseUris();
    
    echo $baseUriInfo->getApiAccessPoint(); // https://api.echosign.com
    
## Creators
Some of the more complex request are a pain to build, so try using one of the Creators instead. This one for example will create a transient document from a local file, then create a signing request for the specified email.

    use Echosign\Creators\Agreement;

    $agreementCreator = new Agreement( 'YOUR oAUTH TOKEN' );
    $agreementId = $agreementCreator->createTransientAgreement(  $signerEmail, $message, $filepath, $agreementName  );
